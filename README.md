# Nuxt 2 Migration Example

This repo contains a Nuxt 2 site in the main branch and the same site migrated to Nuxt 3 in the migrated branch.

In order to get from Nuxt 2 -> 3, the best process I've found to follow is such:

1. Create a new Nuxt 3 project with `npx nuxi init [project-name]`
2. Move files one by one from the old project to the new and update syntaxes based on the advice from the [official migration guide](https://nuxt.com/docs/migration/overview).
